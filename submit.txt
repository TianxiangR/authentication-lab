Question 1
It uses Basic Auth.
./manage.py createsuperuser will allow you to create an account with username and password
or in the admin dashboard page, you can create a user with a username and a password
You can specify permission classes to control the access permissions of certain endpoints

Question 2
Basic Auth

Question 3
session authentication is a stateful authentication, so the server keeps track of user's session which is a state, and it sends you a session id and it will be stored in the cookie
token authentication is stateless.

Token auth is more secure because it would expire, but for basic auth, the username and password are unlikely to change in a long time.
Basic auth will trigger browser's pop up for entering the username and the password, but with Token auth, we can customize the UI for login.

Question 4
Clicking on "Login with Google" will redirect you to Google's authentication page.
You will enter your google account's email and password.
If successful, it will ask you for consent ("allow access" form)
If you agreed, then it will redirect you back to "bitbucket.org"
